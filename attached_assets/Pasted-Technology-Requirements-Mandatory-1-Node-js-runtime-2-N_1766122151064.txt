Technology Requirements (Mandatory)
1 Node.js (runtime)
2 NestJS (latest stable version)
3 TypeScript
4 Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite / MongoDB
5 ORM recommended: Prisma or TypeORM
6 REST APIs (JSON)
7 Frontend or UI is NOT required

Problem Statement

Build a multi-tenant backend API using NestJS for an internal Issue Management system used by
multiple organizations. Each organization (tenant) must have strictly isolated data. Users belong to
exactly one organization and have one role: ADMIN or MEMBER.
Authentication is NOT required. You may mock user context (userId, organizationId, role) using request
headers, a custom middleware, or a Guard. Authorization and data isolation must be enforced entirely on
the backend.

Core Backend Requirements

1 Multi-Tenancy: All data must be scoped by organizationId and enforced in services or guards.
2 Issue Management: Create, read, update, and delete issues.
3 Role-Based Authorization: Only ADMIN users may update status, assign, or delete issues.
4 Activity Log: Status or assignee changes must generate persistent activity records.

Required API Endpoints
1 POST /issues
2 GET /issues
3 GET /issues/:id
4 PATCH /issues/:id
5 DELETE /issues/:id
Out of Scope (Explicit)
1 Authentication or login systems
2 Frontend or UI development
3 Deployment, Docker, or hosting
4 Automated testing (unit, integration, or e2e)

Mandatory Architecture Questions (README.md)
1 How did you implement multi-tenancy in NestJS?
2 Where does authorization logic live (Guard vs Service) and why?
3 How would you prevent cross-organization data leaks in production?
4 What parts of this system would break or need redesign at scale (10,000 organizations)?
5 What features did you intentionally skip due to time constraints and why?

Submission Rules (Strict)
1 Submit only a public GitHub repository link.
2 Repository must include README.md with setup instructions and architecture answers.
3 Include a .env.example file (no secrets).
4 Application must start successfully using npm run start.
5 Late or incomplete submissions will be rejected.
